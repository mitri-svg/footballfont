            <p class="im1">Lional Messi</p>
            <p>Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronuncia tion: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24 June
                1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and
                captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as
                one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a
                record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving
                the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record
                34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four
                times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific
                goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most
                hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and
                the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (103). Messi
                has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a
                single club (672).

            Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut
            aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three
            years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in
            Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed,
            with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times.
            During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season,
            while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished
            second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best
            form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a
            historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
            Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club
            Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined
            American club Inter Miami in July 2023.

            An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national
            record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the
            tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
            His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona,
            who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest
            Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América,
            where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina
            to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa
            América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement
            in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a
            third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden
            Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this achievement, Messi received a record-extending seventh Ballon
            d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden
            Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World
            Cup (26).

            Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's
            highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's
            highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the
            world in 2011, 2012 and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with
            Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi became the second footballer and
            second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.</p>

            <p class="im2">Neymar Júnior</p>
            <p>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (born 5 February 1992), known as Neymar Júnior or mononymously as Neymar,
                is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and
                the Brazil national team. A prolific goalscorer and playmaker, he is widely regarded as one of the best
                players in the world as well as one of the greatest Brazilian footballers of all time.[3][4][5] Neymar
                has scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs, making him one of four players to achieve this
                feat.[6]
            <div class="img img2 i"></div>


            Neymar came into prominence at Santos, where he made his professional debut aged 17.<div class="f2 img f">
            </div> Soon becoming the
            Brazilian's league star player, he won the 2011 Copa Libertadores, being Santos' first since 1963. He
            was named the South American Footballer of the Year in 2011 and 2012, and relocated to Europe to join
            Barcelona in 2013. In his second season, as part of Barcelona's attacking trio with Lionel Messi and
            Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN, he won the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA
            Champions League. Motivated to be the focal player at club level, Neymar unexpectedly transferred to PSG
            in 2017[7] for €222 million, which made him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] In his debut season,
            he excelled in French football, winning the league title and being voted Ligue 1 Player of the Year.[10]
            Despite recurring injuries in Paris, he helped PSG attain an historic domestic quadruple in the 2019–20
            season, and was integral to PSG reaching its first ever Champions League final, being named in the UEFA
            Team of the Year for the second time in his career.

            Debuting for Brazil aged 18, Neymar is currently joint-top goalscorer for his national team alongside Pelé,
            with 77 goals in 124 matches. He won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. His
            participation in the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2015 Copa América was cut short by injury and a suspension,
            respectively, before captaining Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football at the 2016
            Summer Olympics, having already achieving a silver medal at the 2012 edition. Having renounced the
            captaincy, he featured at the 2018 World Cup, and after missing the 2019 Copa América through injury, helped
            Brazil to a runner-up finish at the 2021 tournament.

            Neymar finished third for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 and 2017, has been awarded the FIFA Puskás Award, has
            been named in the FIFA FIFPro World11 twice, and the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season three times.
            Off the pitch, he ranks among the world's most prominent sportsmen. SportsPro named him the most marketable
            athlete in the world in 2012 and 2013, and ESPN cited him as the world's fourth-most-famous athlete in 2016.
            In 2017, Time included him in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[11] In 2018,
            France Football ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid footballer. The following year, Forbes ranked
            him the world's third-highest-paid athlete,[12] dropping a spot to fourth in 2020.[13]

            Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da
            Silva and had a Christian upbringing.[14][15] He inherited his name from his father, who is a former
            footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[16] Neymar comments on his
            father's role: "My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and
            my family."[17] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[18] Neymar said that
            futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and
            ability to perform moves in tight spaces.[19]

            In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa
            Santista.[20] Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos.[21] With the success of
            his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro,
            Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais
            per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was
            upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals.[22]

            <p class="im3">Cristiano Ronaldo </p>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5
                February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both
                Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the
                greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden
                Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league
                titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo
                holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League,
                goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200).
                He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored
                over 800 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the highest goalscorer of all
                time.

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the
            FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
            Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
            subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a
            transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
            Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to
            2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again
            in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also
            became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished
            as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won
            four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World
            Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most
            expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two
            Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and
            became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned
            to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract
            was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

            Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps,
            making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the
            all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first
            international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the
            national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the
            Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at
            Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement
            would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations
            League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top
            scorer of Euro 2020.

            One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete
            by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him
            on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the
            third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

            Early life
            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the
            capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[8][9] He is
            the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro,
            a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[10] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da
            Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[11] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older
            sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[12] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom
            his father was a fan of.[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's
            alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[14][15]
            as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[16] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic
            home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[17]

            As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[18] where his father was the kit man,[10] and
            later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who
            signed him for a fee of £1,500.[19] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join
            Sporting's youth academy.[19] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and
            agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[20] With a troubled life as a
            student[21] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond
            the 6th grade.[22][23] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a
            chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[20] One year later, he was diagnosed with
            tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[24] Ronaldo underwent heart
            surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart
            rate.[25] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days
            later.[26]</p>

            <p class="im4">Karim Benzema</p>
            <p>Karim Mostafa Benzema (born 19 December 1987) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker
                for Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad. Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he is a creative
                forward renowned for his goal-scoring ability, as well as his technical skills, vision, and versatility
                on the field.[4][5][6] He is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist
                provider.[7] Benzema won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del Rey, and
                five UEFA Champions League titles.
            <div class="f f4 img"></div>
            <div class="img img4 i"></div>

            Born in Lyon to Algerian parents, Benzema began his career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005,
            contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year
            and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league
            title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer
            when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut
            season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly
            rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed BBC — who were integral to four Champions
            League wins from 2014 to 2018.

            Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker.
            He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won La Liga
            Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League
            top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before
            signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.

            A French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut
            for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major
            tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left
            out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being
            implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his
            international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football
            four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the
            Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old,
            he is the second-oldest winner of the award, after Stanley Matthews.[9]

            Benzema began his football career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC at the age of eight. While at the
            club, he was nicknamed Coco by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon
            youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city.[11][12] According to Serge
            Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an
            attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused.[13] After talking with Benzema's father, the
            club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon.[13] Following the trial, Benzema officially joined
            Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.[14]</p>

            Suárez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before
            transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup and the Eredivisie. In 2011, Suárez signed for
            Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. Having established a strike
            partnership with Daniel Sturridge, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season
            and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Suárez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth
            £64.98 million (€82.3 million), making him one of the most expensive players of all time.

            Dubbed MSN, Suárez was part of a dominant trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, winning the treble of La
            Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in his first season. In his second season, he won the
            Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards
            other than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[4] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so
            in both goals and assists in league history.[5][6] With Barcelona, Suárez won ten additional trophies,
            including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atlético Madrid in 2020, winning his
            fifth La Liga title in his debut season.[7]

            At international level, Suárez is both Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, as well as the all-time top
            scorer of FIFA World Cup qualifiers in CONMEBOL.[8] He has represented his nation at four editions of the
            FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa América, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA
            Confederations Cup. He was named in the 2010 World Cup All-Star Team and won the 2011 Copa América, where he
            was awarded Best Player. Outside of his football credentials, Suárez has been a source of controversy
            throughout his career,[note 1] including a goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup,
            biting opponents on three occasions,[note 2] accusations of diving,[16][17] and racial incidents.

            Suárez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo
            Artigas.[19] At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he
            played youth football at Urreta.[20] When he was a child, a car ran over his foot, breaking the fifth
            metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play.[21]

            Suárez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Suárez struggled because he could not speak
            Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game.[26] His teammate and fellow
            Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team.[26] He
            worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language.[26] Suárez
            scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007,
            he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card.[27] Suárez especially made his mark
            in a 4–3 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two
            goals.[28] Suárez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances[29] to help Groningen finish eighth in the
            2006–07 Eredivisie.[26] He also scored in a 4–2 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14
            September 2006.[26][30]

            Ajax saw potential in Suárez and offered Groningen €3.5 million for him, but Groningen rejected the
            offer.[31] Suárez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s
            arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale.[31] The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9
            August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to €7.5 million and Groningen accepted.[32][33]
